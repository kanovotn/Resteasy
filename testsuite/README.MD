# Introduction
The aim of testsuite module is to provide unit and integration tests for Resteasy.

# Test documentation
With each new test write appropriate javadoc documentation.

We keep test documentation for test cases (test classes) as follows:

```
/**
 * @tpChapter Main chapter name (see chapter structure below)
 * @tpSubChapter Sub-chapter name (see chapter structure below)
 * @tpTestCaseDetails Description of the test class, id of JIRA issue if applicable
 * @tpSince RESTEasy 3.x.x (in which version of resteasy was this test added) [optional]
 */
```

The test methods itself are annotated as follows:

```
/**
 * @tpTestDetails Description of what the test does
 * @tpSince RESTEasy 3.x.x (in which version of resteasy was this test added) [optional]
 */
```
